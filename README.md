# Vinyl

A community for record enthusiasts to review their favorite albums.

Part of the application has already been built for you. Your job is to take it to completion.

## Getting Started

The app uses a simple file structure for an Express web app server that renders views using EJS templates.

```sh
public/               # static assets
src/
  actions/            # async server actions (e.g. data CRUD)
  data/               # db schema & seed data
  db/                 # database client & utils
  routes/             # express routes
  views/              # html templates
test/                 # test files for the source files
```

# Coding Challenge

During the interview you will have 60 minutes to complete all the specs of the challenge.

You'll be allowed to ask your interviewer clarifying questions and can use the internet to search for information as needed.

Each requirement is assigned a point value. A fully complete requirement will earn you full points; partially complete requirements get partial points; incomplete requirements get no points. Overall completeness is determined by dividing the total points earned by the total points available. There is a requirement of completion of 80% of the specs to secure a passing result.
